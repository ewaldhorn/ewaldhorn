### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This is my GitHub profile, true story!  

******************************************************************************************************* <br><br>
I also have a [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/ewaldhorn) profile, so if this one appears quiet, check there, I'm probably working on something for a client that prefers a different service. <br><br>
******************************************************************************************************* <br>

## What's here
Just some things I've worked on.  I am always exploring technologies, trying new things and learning in the process.  You'll find some code I've worked on here, but please be careful running it on your machine - it is experimental, after all...  

** _If you are here looking for one of my talks, ask yourself why'd you do that to yourself?! If you insist, I try to keep a list going on [my website](https://nofuss.co.za/about/) that links to videos and resources, where available._ **

## Who am I
Who cares? I'm just some random chap on the internet doing random things in random technologies.  Don't believe all the stories you hear. I probably don't know what I'm doing, certainly don't know what I'm talking about and most definitely should not be allowed to write code that's seen by anyone, or, these days, any, errr, _entity_.

## What I do
Stuff. Lots and lots of stuff.  Usually, I'll be annoying the [Go](https://go.dev/) or [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/) compilers by building either esoteric or truly weird and whacky solutions.  If it's something that needs doing, I'll get busy doing it.  Having a lot of mobile experience is beneficial, as I can design and implement API's that make life easier for my mobile development team members.  I also spend some time building browser-based solutions using [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), not so much websites, but usually more along the line of web applications. The browser is a powerful platform that can do increasingly more impressive levels of complex work.

I've also used [TypeScript](https://nofuss.co.za/blog/typescript_canvas/) a bit, to get a feel for the language and the possibilities both on the web and for building API's.  Still, pretty much all of my work these days revolve around Go and/or JavaScript, and I'm really happy with the flexibility of this combination, especially since it also opens up a world of possibilities in the [WebAssembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly) space. My take on [Wasm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly) is that is really opens up new frontiers and I'm actively exploring it to deliver even more value to my clients. Towards that end, I've also used [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [Go](https://go.dev/) to build Wasm modules for some projects.

## About mobile apps
Yes, I'm known for having worked on Android apps in Java, Kotlin and C++, as well as in Flutter etc.  The reality is that the need for niche developers have shrunk and I'm rather tired of building the same app over and over and over. So I've mostly left generic mobile behind. If it's a really tricky app that maybe also requires a bespoke Rust/C/C++ layer or is truly challenging, I might be interested.  Just promise to not be offended if I'm not excited to build the "X of Y" style apps.

As an aside, I'm also definitely not interested in "just finishing off an app that is 95% done already", for so many, many reasons. 

## Wait a second
But, if I don't build mobile apps anymore, why is there so much [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and [Dart](https://dart.dev/) code here? And it seems like more is added now and again? Well, you see, while I mostly don't build generic mobile apps anymore, I do use Flutter and Dart to build highly bespoke desktop and web apps, especially data visualisation dashboards and such tools. Now and again, you'll also find me rolling out a Flutter mobile app for a client, but that's the exception to the rule.

## Getting Ziggy with it
Corny, yeah, but I've now done a few small bits and bobs of projects in [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) and it's starting to grow on me, especially as a drop-in C-compiler replacement. Of course, there's more to Zig than just a great toolchain, the language itself is neat! Apart from small CLI utilities that I use during data migration operations, Zig has also proven to be a viable Web Assembly (wasm) language. I'm happily exploring the world of Zig a bit more as I think it has great potential to help solve some of the challenges my clients face.

## Just for giggles
Oh my, I'm doing a lot of C to Go translation (and most recently Zig), so I'm busy refreshing my [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) knowledge a bit as well.  For a 50+ year old language, it's still got some decent tricks and is very useful for cross-platform development.

## You didn't mention .NET/C#/Xamarin
That's correct. I used to work in [Xamarin](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/xamarin), but haven't in years and I'm so out of touch with the .NET world now that I'm a hard .NO for this kind of work.

## Can we pay you to stay away
Yes! Definitely! It might actually be a bit cheaper to hire me, but, hey, whatever works for you is good!

Peeps looking to throw money at me for solving their problems can visit my [most awesome website](https://nofuss.co.za/) for more information. 

Sorry, I designed the logo myself. You can tell.

## Alright, how can we find out more about you

You should probably check out my [About](https://nofuss.co.za/about/) page, it also has a handy list to some of the talks I've given and their atrocious slides and source code, where available.

Besides that, I've been on the internet for a bit and you'll find me in the usual places:

## Being picked on by recruiters
Oh my hat is Vanessa picking on my dumb profile again? Hello Vanessa!

### Language stats for public code repos
This is interesting if you find this kind of thing interesting, but really boring if you don't. These stats are generated by an external 3rd party and could be unavailable at times.

#### Wow, you got this far
Can't believe it.  Alright, you can go see the [toys](https://nofuss.co.za/toys/) if you like.
