### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This is my GitHub profile, true story!

## What's here
Just some things I've worked on.  I am always exploring technologies, trying new things and learning in the process.  You'll find some code I've worked on here, but please be careful running it on your machine - it is experimental, after all!

## Who am I
Who cares? I'm just some random chap on the internet doing random things in random technologies.  Don't believe all the stories you hear. I probably don't know what I'm doing, certainly don't know what I'm talking about and most definitely should not be allowed to write code that's seen by humans or compilers.

## What I do
Stuff. Lots and lots of stuff.  Usually, I'll be annyoing the Kotlin compiler by either building esoteric Android apps or truly weird and whacky desktop apps using emerging technologies like Jetpack Compose.  If it's something that needs doing, I'll get busy doing it.  Peeps looking to throw money at me for solving their problems can visit my [most awesome website](https://www.nofuss.co.za/) for more information.

At the moment though, I'm doing a deep dive into the world of [Go](https://go.dev/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), because I find myself doing more backend and web assembly work these days.  Having a lot of mobile experience is beneficial, because I can design and implement API's that make life easier for my mobile development team members.  I'm also playing around with [TypeScript](https://www.nofuss.co.za/blog/typescript_canvas/), getting a feel for the language and the possibilities both on the web and for building API's.

## Being picked on by recruiters
Oh my hat is Vanessa picking on my dumb profile again? Hello Vanessa!
